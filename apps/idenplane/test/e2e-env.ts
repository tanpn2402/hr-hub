 * Runs (via jest `setupFiles`) before any spec — and therefore before
 * `test/setup.ts` statically imports `AppModule` — so the values below are
 * already in `process.env` when `ThrottlerModule.forRoot([...])` reads them.
 *
 * The global @nestjs/throttler guard defaults to 100 requests / 60s per IP.
 * The E2E suite runs single-worker and issues thousands of requests from one
 * loopback IP, which would otherwise trip the limiter and return 429 for most
 * tests. Rate limiting itself is exercised by dedicated specs that configure
 * per-realm limits explicitly; the global guard must not throttle the harness.
 *
 * Production is unaffected — these only apply when the E2E config loads.
