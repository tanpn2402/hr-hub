/**
 * The failure path, end to end, against a real database.
 *
 * #1200 proved the backup/restore mechanics in isolation: pg_dump writes a real
 * archive and pg_restore puts deleted rows back. What no test covered was the
 * thing the whole feature exists for — an upgrade that gets past the backup and
 * then fails, and whether the automatic rollback actually runs and completes.
 *
 * That path had three independent defects fixed across #1197-#1199 (the audit
 * row never carried a backupId when it was needed; the archive could not be
 * restored; the health check could never pass), each of which would have made
 * this scenario fail. None of them were caught by a test that mocked the shell.
 *
 * The failure is induced by hiding a table that the post-upgrade health check
 * requires, which fails deterministically on every platform. Nothing here is
 * mocked — real pg_dump, real pg_restore, real `prisma migrate deploy`, real
 * Postgres.
 *
 * Skipped, loudly, when the pg tools are unavailable.
