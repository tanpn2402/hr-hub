# node:25-alpine (and node:25-slim) breaks `prisma generate` under QEMU arm64
# emulation with a nonsensical "does not start with any known Prisma schema
# keyword" error — actually a JSON-parsing bug in Prisma's engine on that
# combination, unrelated to schema content. amd64 is unaffected; this only
# surfaced because docker-publish.yml's actual tag-generation bug (fixed
# separately) had been silently preventing this stage from ever running on a
# push to main. Tracked upstream: https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/29464.
# Pinned to 22 (not just reverted) to match what CI's actions/setup-node already
# tests against everywhere else in this repo — re-bump once that issue closes.

# The Prisma client is generated explicitly in the build stage instead.

# pg_dump / pg_restore, used by the upgrade flow to take a backup before running
# migrations and to restore it on rollback. Without these the upgrade endpoints
# abort at pre-validation (by design — an upgrade that cannot be rolled back
# should not start), so this is what makes UPGRADE_API_ENABLED usable at all.
#
# The client major must EQUAL the server major. An earlier revision of this file
# claimed "client >= server is the supported direction"; that is true for taking
# a dump and false for restoring one. Measured against a PostgreSQL 16 server:
#
#   pg_dump 18   → archive written fine
#   pg_restore 18 → ERROR: unrecognized configuration parameter
#                   "transaction_timeout"      (that GUC arrived in PG 17)
#   pg_restore 16 on that same archive
#                 → ERROR: unsupported version (1.16) in file header
#
# So a newer client produces backups that nothing can restore onto an older
# server — the rollback is broken exactly when it is needed. An older client is
# no better: pg_dump refuses to dump a newer server outright.
#
# Alpine's default postgresql-client tracks the newest release, so pinning is
# required rather than optional. PG_MAJOR must match the PostgreSQL server this
# image will be pointed at; docker-compose.yml ships postgres:16-alpine.
# The application also verifies this at runtime (pre-validation check
# `pg_client_version`) and refuses to upgrade on a mismatch, so a wrong value
# here fails loudly rather than silently disabling rollback.
