# Contributing to Idenplane

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Idenplane!

## Getting Started

### Fork and clone

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub (the "Fork" button at the top of [idenplane/idenplane](https://github.com/idenplane/idenplane)).

2. **Clone your fork** and add the upstream repo as a remote:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/idenplane.git
cd idenplane
git remote add upstream https://github.com/idenplane/idenplane.git
```

3. **Keep your fork in sync** before starting new work:
```bash
git fetch upstream
git checkout dev
git merge upstream/dev
```

### Development Setup

1. **Install dependencies**
```bash
npm install
```

2. **Set up environment**
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your database credentials
```

3. **Start development database**
```bash
docker compose up -d
```

4. **Run migrations and seed development data**
```bash
npm run db:setup
```

Or separately, if you only want one of them:

```bash
npm run prisma:migrate   # apply migrations
npm run prisma:seed      # seed development data
```

6. **Start development server**
```bash
npm run start:dev
```

### Required Tools

- Node.js 22+
- npm 10+
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Git

## Development Workflow

### 1. Branch Naming

Create branches with descriptive names:

```
fix/<issue-number>-<short-description>
feat/<feature-name>
chore/<maintenance-task>
docs/<documentation-task>
```

Examples:
- `fix/580-idor-token-introspection`
- `feat/add-saml-support`
- `chore/update-dependencies`

### 2. Making Changes

1. **Create a new branch**
```bash
git checkout -b fix/your-issue-description
```

2. **Make your changes**
- Follow the existing code style
- Write tests for new functionality
- Update documentation as needed

3. **Run tests**
```bash
npm test
```

4. **Run linting**
```bash
npm run lint
```

5. **Build the project**
```bash
npm run build
```

### 3. Commit Messages

Use clear, descriptive commit messages:

```
type(scope): short description

- Detailed description (if needed)
- Bullet points for multiple changes
```

Types: `fix`, `feat`, `chore`, `docs`, `test`, `refactor`, `perf`, `security`

Examples:
```
fix(tokens): prevent user enumeration in introspection

feat(mfa): add TOTP verification step-up flow

docs(api): update authentication endpoints documentation
```

### 4. Pull Requests

When submitting a PR:

1. **Fill out the PR template** with:
   - Clear description of changes
   - Link to related issue(s)
   - Testing evidence
   - Screenshots (for UI changes)

2. **Ensure all checks pass**
   - Build succeeds
   - All tests pass
   - No linting errors

3. **Keep PRs focused**
   - One feature or fix per PR
   - Smaller PRs are reviewed faster

### 5. Review Process

Idenplane currently has a single maintainer, so review turnaround depends on their availability rather than a formal rotation — there's no assigned-reviewer system or required approval count beyond that.

- All required CI checks (build, lint, tests) must be green before a PR is merged; a red check is treated as "not ready," not "waiting for an override."
- The maintainer may ask for changes directly on the PR — respond with new commits rather than force-pushing over review comments, so the diff stays reviewable.
- Approved PRs are squash-merged, so write your PR title/description as you'd want the resulting commit message to read; the individual commits within a PR don't need to be clean or atomic.
- There's no fixed SLA on review time. For anything time-sensitive (a security fix, a broken build), say so explicitly in the PR description.

## Code Standards

### TypeScript

- Use explicit types (no `any`)
- Prefer `interface` over `type` for object shapes
- Use proper null handling with strict null checks

### Error Handling

- Always handle errors with proper try/catch blocks
- Use specific error types (`BadRequestException`, `NotFoundException`, etc.)
- Log errors with appropriate context

### Security

- Never expose secrets in logs or responses
- Use parameterized queries (Prisma handles this)
- Validate all input with class-validator DTOs
- Follow OWASP security guidelines

### Testing

- Write tests for new functionality
- Maintain or improve coverage
- Unit tests for services
- E2E tests for critical flows

## Project Structure

The backend has around 60 NestJS modules under `src/`, each self-contained (its own controllers/services/DTOs) — too many to keep an accurate list here without it going stale. A representative sample:

```
src/
├── auth/              # Authentication logic
├── admin-auth/        # Admin authentication
├── oauth/             # OAuth 2.0 implementation
├── saml/              # SAML 2.0 implementation
├── webauthn/          # WebAuthn/FIDO2
├── realms/            # Realm management
├── users/, groups/, roles/, clients/  # Core identity model
├── plugins/           # Plugin loading & integrity verification
├── prisma/            # Database service
├── common/            # Shared utilities
└── ...
```

For the full module map, grouped by concern, with a system diagram, see the [Architecture Overview](/contributing/architecture) on the docs site.

## Database Guidelines

### Prisma Usage

- Always use Prisma Client for database operations
- Use `select` to limit returned fields
- Use `include` for related records when needed
- Avoid raw SQL queries unless necessary

### Migrations

```bash
# Create a new migration
npm run prisma:migrate -- --name add_new_table

# Apply migrations
npm run prisma:migrate

# Reset database (development only) — drops, re-migrates and re-seeds
npx prisma migrate reset
```

## Reporting Issues
